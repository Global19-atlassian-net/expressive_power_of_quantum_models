# The effect of data encoding on the expressive power of variational quantum models

This repository contains code necessary to reproduce the figures and simulation results of the [paper](XXX) "The effect of data encoding on the expressive power of variational quantum machine learning models" by Maria Schuld, Ryan Sweke and Johannes Jakob Meyer. 

The code is presented as a (jupyter notebook)[https://github.com/XanaduAI/expressive_power_of_quantum_models/blob/master/tutorial_expressivity_fourier_series.ipynb], which allows you to play around with different settings.
