# The effect of data encoding on the expressive power of variational quantum models

This repository contains code necessary to reproduce the figures and simulation results of the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08605) "The effect of data encoding on the expressive power of variational quantum machine learning models" by Maria Schuld, Ryan Sweke and Johannes Jakob Meyer. 

The code is presented as a jupyter notebook (called ``tutorial_expressivity_fourier_series.ipynb``), which allows you to play around with different settings and explore the relashionship of typical quantum machine learning models and Fourier series. 

The notebook can also be found as a [PennyLane tutorial](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_expressivity_fourier_series.html).
